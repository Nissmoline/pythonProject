PyProject
The program in Python for creating a two-point perspective projection of 3D shapes. 
I developed a program that performs a two-point perspective projection of 3D shapes (tetrahedron, hexahedron, and octahedron). At the start of the program, 
it displays these three shapes in the main menu, rotating automatically. When a shape is selected, it can be rotated interactively using the mouse. 
The program was implemented using the Pygame and OpenGL libraries.
